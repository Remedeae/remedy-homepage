            <h3>The who what now?
            </h3>
        </legend>
        <p> The tale began over 30 cycles ago, somewhere in the forests
            of Sweden where a tiny lass was born with a crayon in her hand.
            As most children I loved to draw and early showed a sense of
            artistery with the comment 
            <i>"The wallpaper needed blue flowers."</i>
            after remediying the fact that there was only pink flowers on
            said wallpaper.
            <br>
            The other thing I aboslutely obsessed over as a kid was knights.
            Lord in heaven I wanted to be a knight when I grew up, but you
            know reality and the government doesn't really let you do that.
            Anyhow my dad promised me an armor when I stopped growing,
            but I ended up beeing more into motorcycles at that age so that
            didn't happen. But I still remained a nerd at heart so when
            Halloween came around it was always a blast. Then one day I 
            stumbeled over this thing called 'Cosplay' and went "THE WHAT NOW?
            People make costumes and wear them at conventions all year round?"
            <br>
            9 years later and here we are.
