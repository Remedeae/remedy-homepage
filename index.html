                  </h3>
              </legend>
              <p class="presentation"> The tale began over 30 cycles ago, somewhere in the forests
                  of Sweden where a tiny lass was born with a crayon in her hand.
                  As most children I loved to draw and early showed a sense of
                  artistery with the comment 
                  <i>"The wallpaper needed blue flowers."</i>
                  after remediying the fact that there was only pink flowers on
                  said wallpaper.
                  <br>
                  The other thing I aboslutely obsessed over as a kid was knights.
                  Lord in heaven I wanted to be a knight when I grew up, but you
                  know reality and the government doesn't really let you do that.
                  Anyhow my dad promised me an armor when I stopped growing,
                  but I ended up beeing more into motorcycles at that age so that
                  didn't happen. But I still remained a nerd at heart so when
                  Halloween came around it was always a blast. Then one day I 
                  stumbeled over this thing called 'Cosplay' and went "THE WHAT NOW?
                  People make costumes and wear them at conventions all year round?"
                  <br>
                  9 years later and here we are.
